# CN-DSI

This repository contains only one source code file for the WhatsApp-to-AWS transcription workflow: [lambda_function.py](lambda_function.py). This is the code that the Lambda function runs, but most of the set-up is outside of Lambda itself. This README describes how the whole AWS account was configured.

This diagram is an overview of the whole workflow. Each of the steps, and how to set them up, will be described below.
